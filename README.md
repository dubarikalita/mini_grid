# MINI_GRID  
*Empowering Autonomous Innovation Through Intelligent Navigation*

## 🚀 Overview

**MINI_GRID** is a reinforcement learning project where a PPO agent learns to navigate the **MiniGrid-Empty-5x5-v0** environment. The agent observes, learns, and demonstrates intelligent navigation in a partially observable world.
